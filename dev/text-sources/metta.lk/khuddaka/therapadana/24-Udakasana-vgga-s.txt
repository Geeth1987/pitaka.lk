The Blessed One said:


ßDamali, there is no work for the Brahmin, he has done his duties.
Until he gets a footing, man exerts with all his limbs.
Gaining a footing, he stands on hard ground.
Having crossed he does not exert
Damali this is the comparison for the Brahmin.
The concentrating, clever one has destroyed desires,
Have come to the end of birth and death
Does not exert, he has crossed over.û
